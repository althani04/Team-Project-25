        <h2>Your Complete Guide To Brewing</h2>
        <p>
            Brewing the perfect cup of coffee is an art and a science. In this guide, we’ll take you through the essentials of coffee brewing, covering everything from equipment to techniques.
        </p>
        <h3>Essential Equipment</h3>
        <!-- using unordered list instead of pargraphs as it is a list of instructons and allows for 
         use of li tag to specify each individual block of text and format it  -->
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Grinder</strong>:  It is essential to invest in a well crafted “Burr Grinder”. 
                Burr grinders work by crushing instead of cutting your beans into splinters. This allows 
                for more precise and consistent grinding leading to a more flavourful, aromatic and 
                balanced cup of coffee.</li>
<br>
            <li><strong>Kettle</strong>: Another key element of your morning brew. We suggest using a 
                gooseneck kettle as they allow for more precise control over the flow of water leading 
                to a perfect pour for our perfect blend.</li>
<br>

            <li><strong>Scale</strong>: Arguably the most important tool in your morning routine is a 
                quality weight scale. The most advanced sales we recommend give you readings to the 
                nearest 1/10th of  a gram! Furthermore, some of our beans weigh more per bean than 
                other. We found that "Darker Roasts" weigh less compared to "Lighter Roasts"(Yes we weighed them all!)
                and our at home barista’s will know the detrimental impact of being off by even a 
                single gram .Therefore we recommend using a accurate scale which eliminates all this 
                issue all together. To take this even further coffee scales sometimes even a contain 
                feature known as Extraction Timing. Our coffee connoisseurs will definitely know about 
                this but if you don’t check it out in our glossary.</li> 
<br>
            <li><strong>Filters</strong>: The final choice is a metal or paper filter, either can be used
                 so we recommend trying both for yourself.An good filter can enhance the flavour and 
                 aroma of your morning brew by trapping natural oils that would normally make your usual 
                 brew taste bitter or sour. They also help protect your machine from limescale buildup 
                 and some filters are also rumoured to improve the quality of water by removing 
                 contaminants such as chlorine, sediment and even pesticides but you'll have to find that 
                 our yourself.  The most important thing to remember however when buying a filer is 
                 the shape for example from our research we found that cone shaped filters offer a more 
                 citrusy and berry like flavour, whereas flat bottomed filters give more of a dried fruit,
                sweet and floral flavor.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Brewing Methods</h3>
        <!-- same use of ul however ol was used originally but had difficult with autoincrement thus 
         switched back to using ul-->
        <ul>
            <li><strong>French Press:</strong> This method is known as an full immersion method meaning 
                that the ground beans are drenched in hot water which allows the coffee oils and flavours
                to be extracted.This leads to a richer taste compared to other methods.<br></li>
                <!--indented line and x2--><br>
            <li style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Essential Equipment:</strong><br></li>
            <li style="margin-left: 100px;">French Press:A device which allows beans to "steep" in hot 
                water for an exteneded period of time, which results in a more robust and flavourful cup 
                of coffee</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Steps:</strong></li>
            <li style="margin-left: 100px;">Preheat the french press:this helps maintain a constant 
                temperature</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 100px;">Grind: Ensure to use coarse or medium coarse ground beans as 
                grinding the coffee beans too fine will result in a burnt or acrid flavour.</li>
            <li style=" margin-left: 100px;">Add Coffee:Simply add your ground beans to the preheated 
                french press.We recommend the classic ratio of 70 grams per liter of water. Adjust this 
                to suit your french press, for example if your french press only holds 500 mililiters of 
                water use 35 grams of coffee. </li>
            <li style="margin-left: 100px;">Mix: Stir the coffee grounds into the hot water (we suggest 
                3 times to ensure the water has thoroughly mixed with the coffee)</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 100px;">Steep: Let the coffee steep (sit in the hot water). The 
                longer the infusion time the bolder, stronger and more bitter your brew will be.</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 100px;">Plunge: The final step brings out the age old question of to 
                plunge or not to plunge?. We recommend a mix of both for most users unless you have a 
                preference. Implementing a slow, gentle plunge helps limit stirrng up the coffee sediment 
                and bitter flavours. However, if this is still to bitter and/or you stir up too much sediment
                 you can check out James Hoffmans method <a href="JamesHoffman.php">here.</a> </li> 
           <br> <li><strong>Pour Over:</strong> Medium grind, slow circular pours for clarity.</li>
            <br><li><strong>AeroPress:</strong> Quick, versatile, and ideal for experimentation.</li>
           <br> <li><strong>Espresso:</strong> Finely ground coffee, pressurized brewing for a bold shot.</li>
          <br>  <li><strong>Cold Brew:</strong> Steep coarse grounds in cold water for 12–24 hours.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Experiment with ratios, grind sizes, and brewing times to find your perfect cup.
